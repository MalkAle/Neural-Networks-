In this repository I upload projects where code neural networks "from scratch", that is without using frameworks like Tensorflow or Pytorch, only Numpy is used to simplify mathamatical operation which are out of scope of these projects. Another objective is to practice using object oriented programming with Python and Python in general. I have used following tutorials.
