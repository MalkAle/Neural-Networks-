;This is a config file that is used to configure the calculation in the main_config.py file
;You can change values as desired to play around with parameters. Limitations of input values are noted below

[define-plots]
;Boolean values: remove X if plot not desired. X can also be any value
plot_data = X
plot_training = X
plot_testing = X
plot_prediction = X

[define-random]
;This defines wether numpy random_seed(10) is used for reproducible results if you want to play with parameters 
random_seed = X

[define-dataset]
;Must be an integer between 1 and 5000
samples = 200
;Must be a an integer between 1 and 10
classes = 3
;Two options available: vertical or spiral
data_kind = spiral

[define-calc]
;Two variants available: CalcTanh and CalcSoftmax
;CalcTanh uses dense layers with tanh activation function on all layers with MSE loss function
;CalcSoftmax uses dense layers with Leaky ReLu activations for all layers except the output layer
;   output layers uses Softmax activation and Categorical Cross-Entropy loss funciton

;Must be a an integer between 1 and 10. CalcSoftmax can be numerically unstable with hidden_number>1

;for CalcSoftmax only, ignored otherwise
